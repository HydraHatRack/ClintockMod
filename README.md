*Nucleobases* - Orbs represented by the four nitrogenous bases in DNA: Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine, and Thymine. Playing one of these skill cards will link the base, providing a small bonus each turn.

*Adenine* - A nucleobase that applies block at the end of your turn.

*Cytosine* - A nucleobase that deals damage to a random enemy at the end of your turn.

*Guanine* - A nucleobase that provides energy at the start of your turn.

*Thymine* - A nucleobase that deals a small amount of damage to all enemies at the end of your turn.

*Sugar and Phosphate* - Necessary resources when linking bases. The *Biomolecule Pool* relic gives you 3 sugars and 3 phosphates at the start of each battle.

*Amino Acids and the Polypeptide Chain* - Whenever all orb slots are full and you attempt to link another base, the three existing bases will first convert to an amino acid that is bound to the polypeptide chain. Like bases, amino acids will activate at the end of each turn. There is no limit to the number of amino acids you can bind per battle. There are 20 possible amino acids, each with unique attributes.

*Nucleosides* - Cards that link bases without requiring sugar.

*Nucleotides* - Cards that link bases without requiring sugar or phosphate.

*Fluorophore* - Power that increases the effectiveness of linked bases (except Guanine).

*Transposons* - Cards that add a copy to your hand when played.
